            I only started programming in my second year I started programming
            in C# and Java while I was in school and then I adopted JavaScript

            I draw my inspiration from events, things I see online and my
            interactions with people. I sketch out what I need to build and the
            components. This serves as a guide for me as I develop.

            I decided to focus and learn web development because of my love for
            beautiful things.
